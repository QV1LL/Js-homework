At Products Store, we've spent the last six months auditing our entire supply chain to ensure that every accessory we sell meets strict environmental standards.\n\nStarting next month, all our packaging will be 100% plastic-free. We are switching to mushroom-based packaging and soy-based inks. This transition is part of our larger goal to become carbon-neutral by 2030.\n\nFurthermore, we are launching a trade-in program. Send us your old electronics, and receive a 20% discount on any carbon-certified product in our new collection. Together, we can reduce e-waste and build a circular economy.",
